Welcome! I’m a tech enthusiast transitioning from IT System Administration to Cloud and DevOps Engineering. This blog is my space to share knowledge, document my learning journey, and showcase projects that blend automation, cloud computing, and DevOps practices. I'm also thinking to share a slice of my life as well in this blog, just for my refreshment.

Here, you’ll find:
- My notes on Cloud, DevOps, Linux, and HomeLabs tinkering.
- Personal insights from my hands-on experience with tools like Terraform, AWS, and Python.
- A beginner-friendly approach to tackling complex topics like Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and (soon) Kubernetes.

Whether you’re exploring tech for the first time, advancing your career, or simply curious, there’s something here for you. Join me as I learn, build, and share!
