## A Short Intro

Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is Timothy Alexander Tandian, you can just call me Timmy Tandian or Timmy for short. I'm curious by nature and love to look at data and pattern. Although I love tech in general, I consider myself as multidisciplinary or generalist because if I look back at my past, I have had spent some time learning more beyond what I had (psychology, economics, business, management, you name it).

I’m currently based in Japan and have been living here for 10+ years. I speak Indonesian :indonesia:, Japanese :jp:, and English :gb:. Also, I was born in 90's, so some millenials meme you see in the Internet sometimes hit me :hand_over_mouth:. 

## My Learning and Career Journey

My IT career started as an System Administrator in an enterprise in Japan, where I developed a solid understanding in IT operations, computer networking, and cybersecurity. I’ve always been passionate about building and automating systems, and my journey has taken me from managing IT operations to exploring exciting technologies like Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud computing. That's why currently I’m transitioning into the Cloud and DevOps space.

One of my recent projects, the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/faq/), was a rewarding experience where I built a static website hosted on AWS. It was a hands-on opportunity to use DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code. You can learn more about my professional background in my [Cloud Resume](https://timmytandian.com).

Learning while working full-time has its challenges, but I thrive on it. My next goals are to dive deeper into app containerization, Kubernetes, GitOps, and monitoring tools :rocket:.

## Tech Stack

## Beyond Tech

When I’m not geeking out over tech, you can find me enjoying Latin dance — Salsa, Bachata, and Kizomba are my favorites :man_dancing::mirror_ball::woman_dancing:. Dancing and technology might seem worlds apart, but they both teach me creativity and rhythm in their own unique ways.
