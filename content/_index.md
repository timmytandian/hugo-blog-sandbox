# Foreword
Welcome! I’m a tech enthusiast transitioning from IT System Administration to Cloud and DevOps Engineering. This blog is my space to document my learning journey, showcase projects, express opinion that worth sharing. I'm also thinking to share a slice of my life as well in this blog, just for my refreshment.

Topics that I'm thinking to write:
- My notes on Cloud, DevOps, Linux, and HomeLabs tinkering.
- Personal insights from my hands-on experience with tools like Terraform, AWS, and Python.
- A beginner-friendly approach to tackle complex topics like Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and (soon) Kubernetes.

Whether you’re exploring tech for the first time, advancing your career, or simply curious about me, there’s something here for you. Join me as I learn, build, and share!
