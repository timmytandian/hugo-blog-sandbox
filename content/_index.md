Hi there! This blog is a space to document my learning journey, showcase projects, and express opinion that worth sharing. I'm thinking to share some slices of my life as well in this blog, just for refreshment.

In this blog, you may find topics such as:
- My learning notes on Cloud, DevOps, Linux, and HomeLabs tinkering.
- My personal opinion when taking architectural/design decision.
- A beginner-friendly approach to immitate my projects.
- A small story of my daily life.

Whether you’re exploring tech for the first time, advancing your career, or simply curious about me, there’s something here for you. Join me as I learn, build, and share!
